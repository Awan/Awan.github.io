            </div>OpenBSD as new OS I keep my dotfiles on Github/Gitlab. I had to configure many things so I started a dedicated repository.
New Dotfiles I created a new directory dot in my home dir. And cherry picked some of my old dots. I have pushed my new dot directory to Git[hub,lab] as [Awan,Abdullah]/dot respectively.
Old Linux dotfiles Linux users still can find my dotfiles on Github and Gitlab.]]></description>
