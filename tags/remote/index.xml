    <description><![CDATA[What&rsquo;s tmate? On *nix systems, sometimes we need support. And geeks don&rsquo;t like GUI apps just to have your system in front of them, at least I don&rsquo;t like that ðŸ˜‰
tmate is terminal sharing software you can use it to connect with your friends and you both work from there. It&rsquo;s available in many distributions repos and in case you aren&rsquo;t lucky enough, you can compile it from source or there are pre-compiled binaries there in their Github page.]]></description>
