    <description><![CDATA[So you have installed OpenBSD as main OS. Most of the things will work out of the box. But still you have to configure some things.
Lock screen on suspend/hibernate/resume Login as root and create /etc/apm directory if it isn&rsquo;t there already.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7  mkdir /etc/apm echo &#34;pkill -USR1 xidle&#34; &gt; /etc/apm/suspend echo &#34;pkill -USR1 xidle&#34; &gt; /etc/apm/resume echo &#34;pkill -USR1 xidle&#34; &gt; /etc/apm/hibernate chmod +x /etc/apm/suspend chmod +x /etc/apm/hibernate chmod +x /etc/apm/resume   On lid closure, machines mostly get suspended.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[So this is how you can have a fully encrypted OpenBSD installation.
Getting OpenBSD Go to OpenBSD website and download the .img file for your hardware.
Creating install media If you are on some linux or mac, you can use dd command to burn it to USB drive.
Suppose your USB drive is appearing as /dev/sdb in lsblk&rsquo;s output:
1  dd if=install.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1M   Boot from install media Plug the new install media and reboot the system.]]></description>

            </div>OpenBSD as new OS I keep my dotfiles on Github/Gitlab. I had to configure many things so I started a dedicated repository.
New Dotfiles I created a new directory dot in my home dir. And cherry picked some of my old dots. I have pushed my new dot directory to Git[hub,lab] as [Awan,Abdullah]/dot respectively.
Old Linux dotfiles Linux users still can find my dotfiles on Github and Gitlab.]]></description>
