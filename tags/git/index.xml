    <description><![CDATA[Git cherry-picking Aah picking cherries! ❤️
I&rsquo;m using git since I started using linux. Cherry-pick is one of those commands I do alot with git. Right now I&rsquo;m preparing a new cherry and will pick it later. 😉
What&rsquo;s cherry-pick? According to man(1) git-cherry-pick:
1 2 3 4 Given one or more existing commits, apply the change each one introduces, recording a new commit for each. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).]]></description>
